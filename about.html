    <p>
      <i>Chrono Trigger</i> starts in the year 1000 AD on Earth, where a fair is taking place for the one thousandth anniversary of the kingdom. Crono's friend Lucca and her dad invented a teleportation device to show off at the Millenial Fair but instead of teleporting, they time travel instead through Time Gates. They travel to various eras, however travelling to the post-apocalyptic future of 2300 AD would allow them to see events that happened in 1999 AD that destroyed the Earth, caused by an entity called Lavos. Crono and his friends' goal is now to defeat Lavos in the past and change the future.

      The soundtrack for <i>Chrono Trigger</i> was composed mainly by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasunori_Mitsuda">Yasunori Mitsuda</a>. Mitsuda was disappointed by his salary and his current position as a sound designer, and demanded that Squaresoft either make him a composer for a project, or he would quit. He would then overwork himself to the point where he developed stomach ulcers and had to hand off the rest of the music to <i>Final Fantasy</i>'s composer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuo_Uematsu">Nobuo Uematsu</a>.

      <p class="centercaption">The theme that plays during battle: <i>Battle 1</i>, composed by Yasunori Mitsuda.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Gameplay is similar to that of a standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game">role-playing game</a>. You control a party of three around a world map and enter various locations. When you get into a battle, you can use Attacks, Techniques, or use an Item. Each character has a Hit Point meter, a Magic Point meter, and a stamina meter. You must wait for the stamina meter to fill before the character can do something, and once they do an action their stamina meter goes back to zero. Characters can increase their Attack and Defense stats by switching equipment or using items.
      <br><br>
      You can also use Techniques, which take MP to use, but allows a character to deal more damage, hit multiple enemies, or apply a status effect. Characters can also combine Techniques to make Dual and Triple Techs.
