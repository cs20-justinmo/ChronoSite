        <i>Chrono Trigger</i> is a video game developed by Squaresoft and released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995. The designers for the project were known as the Dream Team, consisting of: the creator of the game <i>Final Fantasy</i>, Hironobu Sakaguchi; the creator of the game <i>Dragon Quest</i>, Yuji Horii; and the creator of the famous manga <i>Dragon Ball</i>, Akira Toriyama.
        <br>
        <i>Chrono Trigger</i> would be ported and remade on various consoles, including the PlayStation, the Nintendo DS, Android, iOS, and PC. I recommend playing the SNES, DS, or PC versions.

      <p>
        The soundtrack for <i>Chrono Trigger</i> was composed mainly by Yasunori Mitsuda. Mitsuda was disappointed by his salary and his current position as a sound designer, and demanded that Squaresoft either make him a composer for a project, or he would quit. He would then overwork himself to the point where he developed stomach ulcers and had to hand off the rest of the music to <i>Final Fantasy</i>'s composer, Nobuo Uematsu.

        <i>Chrono Trigger</i> has a cast made up of people from different time periods. The characters were designed by the creator of Dragon Ball, Akira Toriyama, and his style is reflected in <i>Chrono Trigger</i>. Crono is the main character and is the first character the player can control. He can wield Light magic. Crono is from the present, 1000 AD. In this time period, Crono meets two other people, Marle and Lucca. They can wield Ice and Fire magic respectively.
