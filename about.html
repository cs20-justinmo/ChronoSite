        The soundtrack for <i>Chrono Trigger</i> was composed mainly by Yasunori Mitsuda. Mitsuda was disappointed by his salary and his current position as a sound designer, and demanded that Squaresoft either make him a composer for a project, or he would quit. He would then overwork himself to the point where he developed stomach ulcers and had to hand off the rest of the music to <i>Final Fantasy</i>'s composer, Nobuo Uematsu.
