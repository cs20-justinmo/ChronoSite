      Chrono Trigger was developed by Squaresoft and released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995. The designers for the project were known as the Dream Team, consisting of: the creator of the game Final Fantasy, Hironobu Sakaguchi; the creator of the game Dragon Quest, Yuji Horii; and the creator of the famous manga Dragon Ball, Akira Toriyama.

    <h2>Soundtrack</h2>

    <p>
      The soundtrack for Chrono Trigger was composed mainly by Yasunori Mitsuda. Mitsuda was disappointed by his salary and his current position as a sound designer, and demanded that Squaresoft either make him a composer for a project, or he would quit. He would overwork himself to the point where he developed stomach ulcers and had to hand off the rest of the music to Final Fantasy's composer, Nobou Uematsu.
